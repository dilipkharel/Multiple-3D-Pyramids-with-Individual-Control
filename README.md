# Multiple-3D-Pyramids-with-Individual-Transformation-Control
This is the code I've been working on for my Graphics Design Class. Here, I'm trying to use 3D arrays to create 
three individual pyramids.

Those three Pryamids must act like individual objects. Each Pyrmaid sholud be selected with keystrokes or on-screen 
toggle button.
